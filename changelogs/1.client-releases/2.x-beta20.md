# Cider 2.x (Beta 20)

#### ðŸ¥³ Happy New Year! Here's our first beta of 2023.

First beta build in a while, but we have been putting in a few new features throughout the holiday.

#### In this build:

- **New home page design** with a more modern and personalised look.

  - The new welcome message uses your Cider Connect username or your Apple Music Social Profile name.
  - This is still being worked on and may change.

- UI fixes, shadow changes and other miscellaneous visual changes.
  - A new configuration option to disable the album banner's editorial layout has been added.
  - Lots of the latest changes are the team optimising the interface for UWP.
- Translations are no longer bundled into the application (Electron Only Currently).

  - We now fetch translations on startup, which reduced bundle size a fair bit.

- Additional changes have also been made on the backend:
  - Playlists have been moved to our v3Turbo call for more performant loading.
  - Some setup for LastFM within Cider Connect has been added.
  - Further work on Spotify integration within the app has been done.

_There's a few other things, but version tracking has gone out the window. Enjoy the build!_
