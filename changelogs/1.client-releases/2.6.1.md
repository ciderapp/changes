# What's changed

- **New rewritten Playlist and Album pages**
	- We've rewritten some of the oldest code in Cider and it's better than ever.
	- Separated playlist and album logic to allow for better a tailored experience for each one
	- Improved loading times
	- Improvements to responsive layouts
	- **Playlist Specific**
		- Tracks can now be arranged without entering the Edit Tracklist mode.
			- Edit Tracklist will remain available for touch screen users under the menu
		- Smarter track fetching and refresh handling
		- Playlist track suggestions that get added now get removed from the suggestion list to allow new suggestions to take their place
	- **Album Specific**
		- Enhanced Editorial Layout that now affects more of the album page than before
			- On Calico layout, the top bar colors are now adapted to the editorial banners colors
		- Library albums now feature the same content as the catalog versions when available
			- Editorial artwork
			- Animated artwork
			- Curator notes
		- Discs numbers are now displayed in the track list and can be collapsed
		- Improved and more detailed curator notes

- **Cider Audio Changes**
	- Split Cider Audio Labs from Cider Audio
		- More Cider Audio Labs presets by Maikiwi are now available from the Marketplace and are updateable independent from Cider itself
	    - If you were using a preset that has been moved to the marketplace you will be prompted on startup to download the plugin to restore your previous settings
	- Fixed Audio Normalization not working in previous version
	- New Spatial Presets:
	    - Maikiwi ('25 Signature A)
	    - Maikiwi ('25 Signature B)
  - The Audio Settings UI now slides in from the top and can be collapsed temporarily to allow changing other settings and tracks while fine-tuning your settings
- Marketplace listings are now cached on client
- Added tweak: Allow change playback rate everywhere
- Added tweak: Allow resizing of Mini Player
- Right sidebar state is now preserved when switching between the main UI and Immersive
- Reduced OTA update bundle size
