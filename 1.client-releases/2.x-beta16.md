# Cider 2.x (Beta 16)

**Happy Monday! Getting cold, innit?**

Today is mainly about giving Cider 2's Audio Lab the love it deserves over 1.

### Audio:

- Added configurable max volume property for the volume slider.
  - Currently only configurable through DevTools' Console:
  ```js
  CiderApp.config.set("audio.maxVolume", 0.45);
  ```
- Added option for advanced `dB SPL` tooltip in place of `%` under `Visual -> Advanced`.
  - Built mainly for audio enthusiasts like me to take care of our ears.
  - The description should be rather self-explanatory but feel free to ping Maikiwi for questions.
- Fix Spatial Profile Names (was showing internal codenames).
- General cleanup and performance uplift. (~8%)
- Removed CAP Legacy and Static Compilation Mode.
- Revised CAP `Adaptive` to "`Adaptive+`", which is the one that was set to be released with the thanksgiving update.
  _I **HIGHLY** encourage you to try this version if you HATED prev. CAP._

### General UI/UX:

- Lyric Scrolling is anywhere from ~25-50% more responsive to the actual vocals.
  - This includes a fix that addresses lyric view glitching due to more than one vocal at a time.
  - "think almost everyone will come all over that" (qwack -> maikiwi on this change)
- Add the 'add to library' button for places that need it.
- Option for Discord RPC to clear on pause.
- Fixed occasional analytics hanging the client.
